This will contain all practice automation test using Selenium WebDriver written in Java. Goal is to implement Page Object Model for the UI Testing.

*****************
1) InputDateTest.java
   
   -> Opening a Calendar Dialog Box and verifying that it can reach the target date on the test.


2) MouseHoverAndPageScrollTest.java

   --> Verifies as the mouse hovers over a menu that a popup options are rendered on the GUI 

   --> Verified that we can scroll into a target section of the page.


3) RetrieveSearchSuggestionsTest.java
   
   -> Writes a text on google's search string and verifies a target string is displayed on the "Recommended Searches".


4) DragAndDropTest.java
   
   -> Added an exercise test to do a drag and drop action via WebDriver. I didn't have a real pass and fail criteria for this test.
